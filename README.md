Change Data Capture
===================

In databases, Change Data Capture(CDC) is used to determine and track the data that has changed so that actions
can be taken using the changed data. This repository contains CDAP plugins which allows capturing the changes
from source databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server and push those changes in realtime
to sinks such as Kudu, HBase, and Database.
